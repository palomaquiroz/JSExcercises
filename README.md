# RR COURSE - 'BECOME A SOFTWARE DEVELOPER' 4TH WEEK PROJECT
Welcome to my 4th week project for the 'Become a Software Developer' RR's course. You'll find here a Javascript file with the resolutions to the excercises proposed.

## Description
For the 4th week, we had 2 main objectives:
* Solve 6 different excercises of: 
  * Variables and operators
  * Strings
  * Arrays
  * If Else conditions
  * For loops
  * Functions
* Make the necessary corrections to the last week project.

In this repo, you'll find:
* An HTML index file that lets you see the results for the excercises in the browser's console.
* An 'excercises' folder with 6 files: 
  * 01_variables_and_operators.js
  * 02_strings.js
  * 03_arrays.js
  * 04_if_else.js
  * 05_for.js
  * 06_functions.js
